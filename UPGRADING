This file lists major changes between release versions that require
ports or applications to be changed. Use it to update a port or an
application written for an older version of lwIP to correctly work
with newer versions.


(CVS HEAD)

  * [Enter new changes just after this line - do not remove this line]

  ++ Application changes:

  * Replaced struct ip_addr by typedef ip_addr_t.

  * Raw API: Changed the semantics of tcp_close() (since it was rather a
    shutdown before): Now the application does *NOT* get any calls to the
    recv callback after calling tcp_close() - this means that it also does
    not get the NULL-pbuf which tells it the remote side has closed, too!

  * Raw API: When calling tcp_abort() from a raw API TCP callback function,
    make sure you return ERR_ABRT to prevent accessing unallocated memory.
    (ERR_ABRT now means the applicaiton has called tcp_abort!)

  * Renamed mem_realloc() to mem_trim() to prevent confusion with realloc()

  * Netconn API: Changed netconn_receive() and netconn_accept() to return
    err_t, not a pointer to new data/netconn.


  ++ Port changes

  * Added 3 new files: def.c, timers.c, timers.h
  
  * Separated timer implementation from sys.h/.c, moved to timers.h/.c

  * Converted and semaphore functions to take pointers to sys_mbox_t/sys_sem_t;

  * Converted sys_mbox_new/sys_sem_new to take pointers and return err_t;

  * Added Mutex concept in sys_arch (define LWIP_COMPAT_MUTEX to let sys.h use
    binary semaphores instead of mutexes - as before)

  * Integrated loopif into netif.c - loopif does not have to be created by the
    port any more, just define LWIP_HAVE_LOOPIF to 1.

  * Netdb uses a memp pool for allocating memory when getaddrinfo() is called,
    so MEMP_NUM_NETDB has to be set accordingly.

  * Snmp-agent uses memp pools instead of the heap, so MEMP_NUM_SNMP_* have to
    be set accordingly.

  * Added define LWIP_RAND() for lwip-wide randomization (needs to be defined
    in cc.h, e.g. used by igmp)
