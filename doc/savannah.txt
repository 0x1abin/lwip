1 Anonymous CVS checkouts and updates
-------------------------------------

Obtain lwIP from the STABLE tree (on the CVS main trunk)

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip checkout lwip

Or, obtain a specific release as follows:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip checkout -r STABLE-0_6_3 -d lwip-0.6.3 lwip

Or, obtain a development branch as follows:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip checkout -r DEVEL -d lwip-devel lwip

3 How to release lwIP
---------------------

First, checkout a clean copy of the branch to be released. Tag this set with
tag name "STABLE-0_6_3". (I use release number 0.6.3 throughout this example).

Login CVS using pserver authentication, then export a clean copy of the
tagged tree. Export is similar to a checkout, except that the CVS metadata
is not created locally. 

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lwip export -r STABLE-0_6_3 -d lwip-0.6.3 lwip

Archive this directory using tar.

tar czvf lwip-0.6.3.tar.gz lwip-0.6.3

First, make a local release directory to work in, I use "lwip-releases":

mkdir lwip-releases
cd lwip-releases

Now, make a new release by creating a new directory for it (these are
Savannah conventions so that it shows up in the Files list real nice):

mkdir stable.pkg
cd stable.pkg
mkdir 0.6.3
cd 0.6.3

We can now copy the tar archive we made earlier into the release directory:

cp /../../../lwip-0.6.3.tar.gz .

Finally, synchronize this directory upwards to Savannah:

rsync -n -e "ssh -1" -t -u -v -r . likewise@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/lwip

This does a "dry run": no files are modified! After you have confirmed that
this is what you intended to do, remove "-n" and actually synchronize for
real. The release should now be available here:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=lwip

---
Explanation of rsync options used:

-t: preserve file timestamps
-u: do not overwrite existing files, unless they are older
-v: be verbose (long format file attributes)
-r: recurse into directories
-n: dry-run, do not modify anything. 
---

Additionally, you may post a news item on Savannah, like this:

A new 0.6.3 release is now available here:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=lwip&highlight=0.6.3

You will have to submit this via the user News interface, then approve
this via the Administrator News interface.
